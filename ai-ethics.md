In Spring 2025, members of the Statistics Department at Colorado State University organized a discussion group dedicated to exploring the ethics of artificial intelligence. We’re meeting informally every other Friday to dive into various topics in AI ethics, with plans to evolve into a more formal, regular group by Fall 2025.

Our first discussion will be on Friday, March 28 from 3:30-5:00pm at [Avogadro's Number](https://avogadros.com/) (outside on the back porch if weather permits). To get started, here’s an optional reading for our first meeting: [A Framework for Understanding Sources of Harm throughout the Machine Learning Life Cycle](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3465416.3483305)
