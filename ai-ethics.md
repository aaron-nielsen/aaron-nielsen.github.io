In Spring 2025, we will be meeting to informally discuss topics in the ethics of artificial intelligence. We aspire to create a more formal discussion group in Fall 2025.

Our first discussion will be on Friday, March 28 from 3:30-5:00pm at [Avogadro's Number](https://avogadros.com/) (outside on the back porch if weather permits). Here is an optional reading for our first meeting: (A Framework for Understanding Sources of Harm throughout the Machine Learning Life Cycle)[https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3465416.3483305]
