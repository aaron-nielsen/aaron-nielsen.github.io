I have developed two new classes in Sports Statistics and Analytics that are being offered for the first time this year at CSU:<br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>STAT 351 / Sports Statistics and Analytics I / Fall 2022: <a href="sports1-flier.pdf">(Flier)</a> <a href="stat351-syllabus.pdf">(Syllabus)</a></li>
    <li>STAT 451 / Sports Statistics and Analytics II / Spring 2023: <a href="sports2-flier.pdf">(Flier)</a> <a href="stat451-syllabus.pdf">(Syllabus)</a></li>
</ul><br>

I have also coordinated the creation of a new undergraduate certificate in Sports Statistics and Analytics that will be available starting in Fall 2023.
