I have been interested in Sports Statistics since I was very young, often clipping box scores of minor league baseball games to create my own prospect projections. I created two classes in Sports Analytics in 2022 and CSU approved a new undergraduate certificate in Sports Statistics and Analytics in 2023. 

## Classes

I have also developed two new classes in Sports Statistics and Analytics that are now being offered at CSU:<br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>STAT 351 / Sports Statistics and Analytics I / Fall: <a href="../sports1-flier.pdf">(Flier)</a> <a href="../stat351-syllabus.pdf">(Syllabus)</a></li>
    <li>STAT 451 / Sports Statistics and Analytics II / Spring: <a href="../sports2-flier.pdf">(Flier)</a> <a href="../stat451-syllabus.pdf">(Syllabus)</a></li>
</ul>

## Certificate

I have coordinated the creation of a new undergraduate certificate in Sports Statistics and Analytics that is now available at CSU (see below or <a href="/images/certificate.png">click here</a>).
