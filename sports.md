I have coordinated the creation of a new undergraduate certificate in Sports Statistics and Analytics that will be available starting in Fall 2023 (see below or <a href="/images/certificate.png">click here</a>).

I have also developed two new classes in Sports Statistics and Analytics that are being offered for the first time this year at CSU:<br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>STAT 351 / Sports Statistics and Analytics I / Fall 2022: <a href="sports1-flier.pdf">(Flier)</a> <a href="stat351-syllabus.pdf">(Syllabus)</a></li>
    <li>STAT 451 / Sports Statistics and Analytics II / Spring 2023: <a href="sports2-flier.pdf">(Flier)</a> <a href="stat451-syllabus.pdf">(Syllabus)</a></li>
</ul>

I have advised undergraduate research projects involving Sports Statistics and Analytics:
- Matthew Boyd, 2022: <a href="boyd-shifting-research.pdf">Playing the Odds: Defensive Positioning Strategies to Minimize Batting Average in Major League Baseball</a>
- Ethan Creagar, 2022: <a href="creagar-soccer-tracking.pdf">Reading the Game: Predicting Soccer Defender Movement Using Neural Networks</a>
