I was born in Lincoln, Nebraska and have lived in Colorado since 1998. I have four brothers who live in Hong Kong, Washington, Alabama, and Colorado. My wife, Rachel, is a kindergarten teacher in Boulder, Colorado and we have a communist cat named <a href="/images/lenin.jpg">Lenin</a>.

I worked in the tech industry as an electrical engineer for three years before returning to school to pursue my passion for teaching. After completing a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Denver, I joined the faculty of the Department of Statistics at Colorado State University in August 2018. I have taught a wide range of courses in mathematics and statistics at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

I enjoy reading (history, science, philosophy, science fiction, etc) and have recently been reading a lot about the philosophy of science. Rock is my favorite music genre and I love seeing live music. Some of my favorite artists include: <a href="https://youtu.be/R9iIDrpuHlY?t=20">Smashing Pumpkins</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxZ1EfaoIDY">Wilco</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/M7rXwr1QBwI?t=30">Sigur Rós</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpKQOvlDr-s">Grateful Dead</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GqihwUj-8g">Neil Young</a>. I also really enjoy traveling whether it be roadtripping in the USA or backpacking abroad. At present count, I have visited 24 countries. Lastly, I am a huge Chicago Cubs fan and enjoy learning about Sabermetrics, the statistical analysis of baseball records.
