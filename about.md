I was born in Lincoln, Nebraska and have lived in Colorado for the past 20 years. I have four brothers scattered around the globe. My wife, Rachel, is a kindergarten teacher in Boulder, Colorado and we have two slightly obese cats, Stalin and Lenin.

I worked in the tech industry as an electrical engineer for three years before returning to school to pursue my passion for teaching. After completing a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Denver, I joined the faculty of the Department of Statistics at Colorado State University in 2018. I have taught a wide range of courses in mathematics and statistics at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

In my free time, I enjoy reading (history, science, philosophy, science fiction, etc), seeing live music, and spending time with family and friends. I also really enjoy traveling both inside the United States (states I've visited), as well as abroad (countries I've visited). At present count, I have visited 24 countries. Lastly, I am a huge Chicago Cubs fan and enjoy learning about Sabermetrics, the statistical analysis of baseball records.
