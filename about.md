I was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, and moved with my family to Fort Collins, Colorado, in 1998, where I've lived ever since. I am an alumnus of Fort Collins High School ('02) and have earned multiple degrees from Colorado State University ('07, '14, '24) and the University of Colorado ('08, '12, '18), including a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics in 2018.

In August 2018, I joined the Department of Statistics at Colorado State University as an Assistant Professor. I have spearheaded the development of two new courses and an undergraduate certificate in Sports Statistics and Analytics, teaching these courses twice. Additionally, I have taught a diverse array of twenty different courses in statistics and mathematics at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.

Before my academic career, I spent three years in the tech industry as an electrical engineer, focusing on radar signal processing. My transition from tech to academia was driven by a passion for teaching and a desire to further my education.

My wife, Rachel, is a kindergarten teacher, and we share our home with a <a href="/images/clowder.png">clowder of six cats</a> . I am an avid reader with broad interests in philosophy, politics, history, and science fiction, and I have a particular affinity for collecting atlases and almanacs. I am an aspiring philosopher with interests in logic, philosophy of science, political philosophy, and artificial intelligence. My musical tastes range from the free jazz of <a href="https://youtu.be/_0F3Uqmgt-k">Anthony Braxton</a> to the minimalism of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l9Lr9loHG4">Philip Glass</a>. with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpKQOvlDr-s">Grateful Dead</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/2kuWvNv7WV4?t=48">Smashing Pumpkins</a> being my all-time favorite bands. I have seen the Omaha indie rock band <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZNiA5867Eo">Bright Eyes</a> play live 24 times.


Travel and sports are my other passions. I've visited 24 countries, with Munich, Germany as my favorite destination. I enjoy attending college football games in Fort Collins and Lincoln during the fall. I've been a Chicago Cubs fan since age five and I try to watch all their 162 regular-season games. My fascination with Sabermetrics, the statistical analysis of baseball, led me to attend the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) Analytics Conference this past spring.
