I was born in Lincoln, Nebraska and have lived in Colorado since 1998. I have four brothers who live in Ontario, Alaska, Alabama, and Colorado. My wife, Rachel, works as a kindergarten teacher in Fort Collins, Colorado and we have a <a href="/images/clowder.png">clowder of six cats</a>.

I worked in the tech industry as an electrical engineer for three years before returning to school to pursue my passion for teaching. After completing a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Denver, I joined the faculty of the Department of Statistics at Colorado State University in August 2018. I have taught a wide range of courses in mathematics and statistics at the undergraduate and graduate levels. I have been taking classes at CSU as a part of the universityâ€™s employee study privilege and I will be completing a B.A. in Philosophy in May 2024. 

I like reading (philosophy, history, science, politics, science fiction, etc.) and have recently been reading about the intersection of ethics and artificial intelligence. I collect atlases and almanacs. Lately, I have been enjoying the music of <a href="https://youtu.be/_0F3Uqmgt-k">Anthony Braxton</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFWFa83ZzSA">Erik Satie<a/>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBv5hJ_WKjE">McCoy Tyner</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l9Lr9loHG4">Philip Glass</a>. My favorite bands are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpKQOvlDr-s">Grateful Dead</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/2kuWvNv7WV4?t=48">Smashing Pumpkins</a>. 

I enjoy traveling and have visited 24 countries. In the fall, I like to see college football games in Fort Collins and Lincoln. I have been a diehard Chicago Cubs fan since age five and I attempt to watch all their 162 regular season games each year. I am fascinated by Sabermetrics, the statistical analysis of baseball data, and am attending the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) Analytics Conference this spring.
