## Education Overview
I am a proud graduate of Fort Collins High School ('02). Go Lambkins!

I began my academic career at Colorado State University (CSU) in August 2002, earning a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics by 2007.

Following my undergraduate studies, I pursued a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in Digital Signal Processing and Digital Communications, which I completed in 2008.

From 2009 to 2012, while working as an electrical engineer for a defense contractor in Denver, I also earned a second master's degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado Denver. My focus was on Applied Probability, and for my master's project, I developed a hybrid simulation model to analyze multilevel group population dynamics. This research was inspired by group selection models proposed by philosophers of biology.

In 2012, I returned to CSU to study Statistics, earning another master’s degree in 2014. I taught my first class, STAT 204: Statistics for Business Students, in 2013, which piqued my interest in an academic career. After teaching full-time as an instructor in the Department of Statistics in 2015, I returned to the University of Colorado Denver to complete my graduate studies in Mathematics.

I earned a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics in 2018, under the guidance of Dr. Burt Simon. My dissertation, titled "Statistical Analysis of Some Problems in Evolutionary Population Dynamics," explored stochastic and deterministic models, focusing particularly on the evolution of cooperation.

In August 2018, I joined the CSU Department of Statistics as an Assistant Professor and was promoted to Associate Professor in July 2024. 

After taking undergraduate Philosophy courses part-time as a faculty member at CSU, I completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy in May 2024. I am currently taking classes to complete a B.A. in Political Science and am about half done with the requirements. Next, I plan to continue my studies in Philosophy and begin work on a graduate degree. My interest in Philosophy stems from a deep curiosity about the foundational aspects of mathematics, statistics, science, and logic.

## Recent Studies
