## Education Overview

I am a graduate of Fort Collins High School ('02). Go Lambkins!

I began my CSU career as an undergraduate student in August 2002 and earned a bachelor's degree double majoring in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics (B.S.'07).

After undergrad, I started my graduate studies at University of Colorado Boulder studying Electrical Engineering with a focus on Digitial Signal Processing and Digital Communications (M.S.'08).

From 2009-2012, I worked as an electrical engineer for a government contractor in electronic intelligence. During this time, I also completed a second master's degree in Applied Mathematics from University of Colorado Denver (M.S.'12) with a concentration in Applied Probability. My master's project involved the creation of a "hybrid" simulation model to study multilevel group poulation models.

In 2012, I returned to CSU to study Statistics and earned a master's degree in Statistics two years later (M.S.'14). I taught my first course (STAT 204, Business Statistics) in Fall 2013 and quickly became interested in pursuing teaching as a career. I taught full-time as an instructor in the Department of Statistics in Spring 2015 before returning to University of Colorado Denver to complete my graduate studies.

I received a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from University of Colorado Denver ('18) advised by <a href="http://math.ucdenver.edu/~bsimon/">Dr. Burt Simon</a>, and my specialty lies in statistics education. My dissertation was called "Statistical Analysis of Some Problems in Evolutionary Population Dynamics" and it explored stochastic and deterministic models for evolutionary population models, particularly with respect to the evolution of cooperation. 

In August 2018, I joined the faculty in the Department of Statistics as an assistant professor. In addition to teaching, I am also currently working on a second bachelor's degree in Philosophy which I hope to complete in 2024.
