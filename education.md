## Education Overview

<p>I am a graduate of Fort Collins High School ('02). Go Lambkins!

I began my CSU career as an undergraduate student in August 2002 and earned a bachelor's degree, double majoring in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics (B.S.'07).

After undergrad, I was a graduate student at University of Colorado Boulder and earned a master's degree in Electrical Engineering (M.S.'08) with a focus on Digitial Signal Processing and Digital Communications.</p>

<p>From 2009-2012, I worked as an electrical engineer for a government contractor in Denver. During this time, I also completed a second master's degree in Applied Mathematics from University of Colorado Denver (M.S.'12) with a concentration in Applied Probability. My master's project involved the creation of a "hybrid" simulation model to study multilevel group population models.

In 2012, I returned to CSU to study Statistics and earned a master's degree in Statistics two years later (M.S.'14). I taught my first course (STAT 204, Business Statistics) in Fall 2013 and quickly became interested in pursuing teaching as a career. I taught full-time as an instructor in the Department of Statistics in Spring 2015 before returning to University of Colorado Denver to complete my graduate studies.</p>

<p>I received a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from University of Colorado Denver (Ph.D.'18) with a concentration in Applied Probability and Statistics and was advised by <a href="http://math.ucdenver.edu/~bsimon/">Dr. Burt Simon</a>. My dissertation was titled "Statistical Analysis of Some Problems in Evolutionary Population Dynamics" and it explored stochastic and deterministic models for evolutionary population models, particularly with respect to the evolution of cooperation. 

In August 2018, I joined the faculty in the Department of Statistics as an assistant professor. In addition to currently teaching, I am also working on a second bachelor's degree in Philosophy which I hope to complete in 2024. I am particularly interested in Philosophy of Science and Logic. </p>
