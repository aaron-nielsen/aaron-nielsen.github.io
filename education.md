I received a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado Denver in 2018 advised by <a href="http://math.ucdenver.edu/~bsimon/">Dr. Burt Simon</a>, and my specialty lies in statistics education. My dissertation was called "Statistical Analysis of Some Problems in Evolutionary Population Dynamics" and it explored stochastic and deterministic models for evolutionary population models, particularly with respect to the evolution of cooperation.

# Other Interests

At the moment, I'm most interested in learning more about the intersection of philosophy, mathematics, and statistics. I am also interested in exploring more in the areas of international relations, modern physics, philosophy of biology, and number theory.

I am an active member in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/csustatisticsbookclub/">CSU Statistics Book Club</a>. 

I have been taking a semi-random sample of courses at CSU since joining the faculty in August 2018 as a part of the university's employee study privilege. These classes include:
