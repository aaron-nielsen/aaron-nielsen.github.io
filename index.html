<h1>Welcome!</h1> 
<p>Welcome to my academic website! My name is Aaron Nielsen and I'm an assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.stat.colostate.edu">Department of Statistics</a> at <a href="https://www.colostate.edu">Colorado State University</a>. Feel free to drop by my office and say hi sometime.</p>

<p>In Spring 2022, I will be teaching STAT 315 (Intro. to the Theory and Practice of Statistics), STAT 342 (Statistical Data Analysis II), and STAT 472 (Statistical Research).

<p>Lately, I have been developing two undergraduate courses in Sports Statistics and Analytics and hope to offer these courses beginning in Fall 2022.
