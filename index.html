Welcome to my website!<br>
My name is Aaron Nielsen and I'm an assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.stat.colostate.edu">Department of Statistics</a> at <a href="https://www.colostate.edu">Colorado State University</a>.<br>
    Feel free to drop by my office and say hi sometime.


In Spring 2023, I am teaching:<br>
- STAT 315 (Theory and Practice of Statistics)<br>
- STAT 472 (Statistical Research)<br>

<p>I have developed two new classes in Sports Statistics and Analytics that are being offered for the first time this year:<br><br>
