<h1>Welcome!</h1> 
<p>Welcome to my academic website! My name is Aaron Nielsen and I'm an assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.stat.colostate.edu">Department of Statistics</a> at <a href="https://www.colostate.edu">Colorado State University</a>. Feel free to drop by my office and say hi sometime.</p>


<p>In Spring 2023, I will be teaching STAT 315 (Theory and Practice of Statistics), STAT 472 (Statistical Research), and STAT 380 (Sports Statistics and Analytics II).</p>

<p>I have developed two new classes in Sports Statistics and Analytics that are being offered for the first time this year:<br><br>
STAT 351 / Sports Statistics and Analytics I / Fall 2022: <a href="sports1-flier.pdf">(Flier)</a> <a href="sports1-syllabus.pdf">(Syllabus)</a><br>
STAT 451 / Sports Statistics and Analytics II / Spring 2023: <a href="sports2-flier.pdf">(Flier)</a> <a href="sports2-syllabus.pdf">(Syllabus)</a></p>
