This page includes my teaching philosophy and an empirical assessment of my teaching effectiveness. It also serves as a directory for the courses I have taught, which are freely available to current students, alumni of my classes, and any other interested observers. Transitions my website has made over the years---from university servers, to Wordpress, to (now) Github---have led to the loss of several old course websites in the shuffle. People interested in syllabi from previous courses I taught at Alabama and Illinois can e-mail me to obtain a past syllabus.
